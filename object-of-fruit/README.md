# Object of Fruit

## Introduction

Object instantiation is an incredibly powerful feature. If you think of fruit as a class, an item, like an apple, will only have a certain number of bites to it.

## Specs

Create an object from a class named Fruit. When the object is instantiated from the class, set 3 properties on it (name, colour, bites). Also create a function in the class that when called, takes a bite of the fruit and decrements the bites property.

If there are no bites left, console "All gone!", if there was a bite log "So yummy!"
