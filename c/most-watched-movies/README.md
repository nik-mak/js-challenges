# Most Watched Movies

## Introduction

We live in a social age. We always want to know what our friends are watching, or what they are listening to. Well, we are going to cover one of those today!

## Specs

Write a method that will return an array of the top four movie titles that have been most watchlisted by friends of a given user. 

If there are no such movies, it should return an empty list.

Movies with an equal watchlist count should be ordered alphabetically.
