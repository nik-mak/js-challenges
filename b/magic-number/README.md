# Magic Number

## Introduction

There are some crazy phenomina in maths - you're about to discover one!

## Specs

Write a function that prompts the user to enter a 4 digit number, made up of at least 2 different numbers. Rearrange the string of digits to form the largest and smallest 4 digit numbers possible.

Take these numbers, and subtract the smaller number from the larger.

*E.g.* If the user entered 8082
8820 - 0288 = 8532
8532 - 2358 = 6174
7641 - 1467 = 6174

It hits 6174, then stops.

## Optional

Count how many iterations are required to reach the magical number 6174. What is the number 6174?
